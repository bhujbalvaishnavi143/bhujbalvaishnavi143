### 🌟 My Journey into the World of Data Science
A year ago, I was just another student trying to figure out my future. After completing FYBSc, I took a leap of faith and dedicated my gap year to exploring something that had always intrigued me—Data Science. Fast forward to today, I’ve built interactive dashboards, developed Python applications, and analyzed complex datasets.

### 🎓 My Background
I've always loved mathematics and statistics, solving problems for fun and recognizing the hidden patterns in numbers. However, I never realized how these skills could be applied to real-world scenarios until I discovered data science—where numbers meet storytelling. It became the perfect field to combine my analytical thinking with creativity.
